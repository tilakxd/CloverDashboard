In the dashboard, I want you to add a button that will be able to add inventory to the items that we have on hand. 

Using the tags API, gonna grab all the tag IDs and make a drop down to select the vendor. 
Then using the selected tag's ID, make another API request to grab all the items that belong to that tag.  you will need to expand=stock to get the stock of each item

You will also require a CSV of the vendor that includes some aspects such as name, UPC, and stock count. 

The problem is some CSVs don't have a UPC, so instead of using the UPC to cross-reference the items, you'd use the name. So you'd give the option to either cross-reference name or UPC. And then you'd give a dropdown to select which column belongs to either UPC or name. 

ALSO for the upc cross reference you are using the sku attribute from the returned json of each item

The problem is some items in the vendor list on the CSV do not have the tag associated with them on the Clover POS of all the items. For exmplae upc 3198 on vendor csv wont get pulled when u pull all the items from the tag so you would need to find it in the posgres and add the tag id so when you pull it again from the tag specific item list it will appear

 So you would find the UPCs that don't have that tag in the vendor csv (using the local postgres db) and then give an option to add the tag so then you can have a smooth addition of stock. 

 The tricky part is stock is calculated dfferntly for each csv for example for Vendor_Kehe it is caluclated just by the ShipQuantity column. Though for Vendor_CoreMark it is calculated by if Qty * Unit Size but if Broken Case == "✔" its just QTY so Im hoping I can just inject javascript functions into the UI for each vendor and then I can select the vendor config if you have a better idea im all for it.

 The main API REQUESTs you will need for sure

 grab all tags
 grab all items from that tag
 add tags for each item that appears in the csv but are not seen when you do the previous request.(you can get the itemsID using the local postgres db as it has all the items on hand)
 Update the stock by getting current stock adding new stock and putting that number in the post request body
